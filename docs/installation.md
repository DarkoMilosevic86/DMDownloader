# Installation

## Windows

1. Download the latest `.exe` installer from [releases](https://github.com/DarkoMilosevic86/DMDownloader/releases)
2. Run the installer as administrator
3. The application will be installed in:
   - `C:\Program Files\DMDownloader`
   - Configuration is saved in: `%APPDATA%\DMDownloader\config.json`

## Notes

- **SmartScreen** may show a warning due to unsigned publisher.
- If a `config.json` already exists, it **will not be overwritten**.
- When you choose an installation language on the Language screen during setup, DM Downloader will be configured for that language automatically.
For example: if you select German, DM Downloader will be displayed in German.
